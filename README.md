# Java-Prototype-Design-Pattern
Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.

This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.

## Advantage of Prototype Pattern
The main advantages of prototype pattern are as follows:

* It reduces the need of sub-classing.
* It hides complexities of creating objects.
* The clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will be.
* It lets you add or remove objects at runtime.
